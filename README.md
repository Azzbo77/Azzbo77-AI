# Azzbo77-AI

Welcome to my first attempt at building an AI Agent! This is a work-in-progress project, and I’ll be developing it iteratively as I go. The goal is to create a functional AI agent using modern tools and frameworks.

## Current Setup

- Ollama: Used as the core AI model framework.

- Open WebUI: Provides a user-friendly interface to interact with the AI.

- Docker: Everything runs inside a Docker container for easy setup and portability.

## Project Status

This project is in its early stages. Right now, I’m focused on getting the basic components working together. Future updates will include more features, refinements, and documentation as I progress.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Docker installed on your machine

- Basic familiarity with command-line tool
  
### Installation

Follow these steps to set up the project locally:

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Azzbo77/Azzbo77-AI.git
   cd Azzbo77-AI

2. **Run the Docker container**
   ```bash
   docker-compose up --build

3. Open your browser and navigate to http://localhost:8080 (or the port specified in your setup) to access the Open WebUI.

## Next Steps

- Configure Ollama with a specific model

- Add custom functionality to the AI agent

- Improve the UI experience

- Document usage and features
