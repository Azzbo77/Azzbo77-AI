# Azzbo77-AI

Welcome to my first attempt at building an AI Agent! This is a work-in-progress project, and I’ll be developing it iteratively as I go. The goal is to create a functional AI agent using modern tools and frameworks.

- Open WebUI: Provides a user-friendly interface to interact with the AI.

- Docker: Everything runs inside a Docker container for easy setup and portability.
